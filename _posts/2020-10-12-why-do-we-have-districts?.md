Everyone gets upset about gerrymandering. What's the problem with gerrymandering? It means that representation isn't proportional. If party A is supported by 30% of the electorate, then in a proportional system, roughly 30% of the elected officials should be from party A. That sounds nice and democratic, right?

The concern with gerrymandering is that it's possible to draw district lines so that this doesn't happen. Say, in a simplified world, we're electing representatives to a three member congress. Districts X, Y and Z all contain the same number of people, so each elects a single member. In each district, 33% of the voters support party A, and 66% of the voters support party B. Party B has the most support in each district, so it will win all three seats, even though a third of the electorate supports party A. 

It's important to note that you don't need bizarrely shaped electoral districts for this kind of thing to happen. All the [fancy](https://www.chronicle.com/article/meet-the-math-professor-whos-fighting-gerrymandering-with-geometry/) [work](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/geometry-versus-gerrymandering/) around identifying gerrymandering by looking at districts' geometry misses the point. Any time you fragment voters by placing them in separate district, no matter what shapes the districts take, your voting system will get less proportional.

This begs the question, why have voting districts at all? If N% of the electorate like party A, then why not just give party A N% of the seats directly? How would this work exactly? I could see a few different ways to do it::

- You could vote for a party instead of a specific candidate. The party gets seats proportional to how many people vote for it. Israel's Knesset and the Netherlands's House of Representatives apparently [have elections this way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At-large#Israel).
- You could fill the slots with approval voting. Everyone can vote for as many candidates as they like. The candidates with the highest total number of votes get elected. It sees like the Philippines elects its Senate this way. 

- You could vote by ranking a list of candidates. Electoral slots get filled one at a time using instant runoff voting. 

In fact, a little Wikipedia skimming reveals that some places in the *United States* even that had systems like this. Fayette County, Georgia, for example, didn't divide into districts for its city council and school board elections until the federal district court forced them to in 2013.  Why did the court force them to adopt districts, if districts are inherently undemocratic? Because without districts, minorities can get hurt. Fayette County had a black minority (20%). So in any election, if less than 5 seats where vacant, true proportional representation would not give the black minority a single representative. 

This points to an important function of districts. Sometimes we *don't* want proportional representation after all. When the majority has a history of abusing a minority group, the minority group should at least get *some* representation, even if this is disproportionate to its size. Districts are one way of doing this, guaranteeing that the group occupying a proscribed geographic area get a candidate that represents them. But it seems a little indirect. The fact that minorities are tightly clustered in geographic areas is an unfortunate side effect of discriminatory housing policies. It seems a little backwards to pin minority protections on the legacy of a racist system. If we want the votes of minority groups to count a little bit more, why not do that directly? Specifically, in a location that's electing a board with four seats in which 20% of the electorate are black voters, to guarantee that black voters representation, their votes should count as $\frac{0.25}{0.2}=1.25$ times those of their white peers. 

Before you get into a snit about this being unequal and undemocratic and potentially stigmatizing to minority voters, let me point out that districts are *already* undemocratic. Districts *already are* a system for giving minorities disproportionate voting power. It's just a much more fragile system, which admits abuses like gerrymandering. 

Instead of worrying about what district lines to draw, governments would worry about what minorities need special protections. Should gay or trans voters get extra voting power? Should immigrants? More generally, when we deviate from proportional representation, let's be explicit about why we're doing it, and what group we're protecting.
