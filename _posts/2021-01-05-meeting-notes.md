Most meetings I've had to attend have been a colossal waste of time. There are a few different situations where holding a meeting can be useful:

1. Gathering information: You want to learn something, so you ask someone who knows about it to tell you about it. These meetings are successful if you learn what you set out to learn. 
2. Getting feedback. You have an idea, and want to get someone else's perspective on it. These meetings are successful if you discover ways to change your idea for the better. 
3. Giving orders: some has agreed to do a something for you, and you need to provide them specifics about how it should be done. These meetings are successful if the person performing a task for you comes away from the meeting understanding what they need to do. 

I will refer to these as 'purposes'. Meetings might transition between different purposes. Perhaps you want to gather feedback about a proposed project time-line before you assign people to work on it. Perhaps you want those giving you feedback to hear from a source of information first. But at any given time, it should always be clear what type of meeting is going on, and what must be accomplished for it to be successful. With this in mind, let me propose some rules about meetings:

1. Every meeting should have an agenda, and each part of the agenda should have a specific purpose. If you organized the meeting, it is up to you to set this agenda. This agenda should be shared with all participants ahead of time. If the meeting you want to schedule doesn't have one of these purposes, it's probably a waste of time for everyone involved, and you'd be better off not having it in the first place. 
2. Don't invite people to parts of a meeting that are not relevant for them. If you invite someone to share information, having them stick around while you gather feedback or give orders is a waste of their time. 
3. If a meeting participant starts diverging from the current purpose, everyone should feel free to interrupt them. 
4. Anyone invited to a meeting without a clear, purpose-driven agenda should decline the invitation. Only strong negative feedback like this can break someone of a habit of crappy meetings.
