Buddhism teaches us that we are not our judgments. At any given time, different parts of your brain are urging you to make judgments about the world. "Pleasure is good!" one screams, "have more sex!". "Work is tedious!" another shouts, "your job is bad". One exclaims "Knowledge is admirable, read more books!", while another huffs "Trump is bad! Americans are stupid!". These judgments, Buddhism notes, are just sensations from different modules in our brains. There's no difference between them and the arousal we feel when watching pornography or the exhaustion we feel after not getting enough sleep. They come to us uninvited the same way we receive auditory input when music is playing or sensory input when we step on a nail. They are an external, nonessential part of our consciousness.  

There's a major benefit to this perspective. Judgments create desires: desire for pleasure, desire for a lack of pain, desire to be a better person, desire to have better circumstances, desire that others behave a certain way, desire that the world were different somehow. And these desires make us feel bad. Indeed, they are the only things that makes us feel bad. If you stop having desires, you stop suffering.

The trouble, as I see it, is that once you detach yourself from your judgments and desires, you have no guidance of what to do. Helping the poor and curing cancer and getting out of an abusive relationship and cheating on your spouse and committing murder are all kind of the same from the detached Buddhist perspective: each gives in to a different mental judgment. Secular Buddhism rejects the values provided by your moral intuitions (which is all well and good, given that they're often contradictory and lead to suffering), but then it doesn't provide a replacement. 

To live a life that feels meaningful, therefore, you can't completely detach from your judgments. You should view them like the rules of a board game. Yes, they're arbitrary, but they also give your life a cohesive structure. Just as a board game without rules would be no fun to play, a life without judgments or values would feel pointless. But if the rules are causing you to suffer, don't get hung up on them.
